                Good ideas are only the beginning. It takes a team of highly skilled, experienced, and prepared professionals to launch a
                successful software development project. But even with the best of teams, small mistakes early on can become large
                problems during development.

                In this article, we’ll take a look at the most common mistakes that can kill your project, and how best to avoid them.

                Poor Planning
            </div>
            <div class="infoCont">
                The fact that you need a project plan should not be surprising. However, major issues can arise mid-way through or even in the home stretch due to not enough planning beforehand. Good project management is not only necessary at the pre-planning stage, but essential throughout the project to prevent scope creep.
            </div>
            <div class="infoCont infoContBot">
                The design, approval, and development phases should be meticulously planned and communicated to all stakeholders involved before beginning work; then closely monitored throughout the project lifespan. This will enable you to identify potential pitfalls, and make you better prepared to deal with them if/when they arise.
            </div>
            <div class="infoContZag">
                Complicated Feature Set
            </div>
            <div class="infoCont">
                Many companies make the mistake of incorporating too many features into the initial product launch. Or, worse yet, adding new features midway through the development phase. It is important to remember that more features means higher development costs and longer timelines.
            </div>
            <div class="infoCont infoContBot">
                So while it may sound appealing to make your product more robust, it remains best practice to decide on the major deliverables in the planning stage, and stick to that feature set. This is because the goal is to package the core features in a marketable product so you can get it in front of your test market as soon as possible, enabling you to gain feedback from actual customers. This will give you better insight into what customers really want and need, and where best to invest your company’s resources moving forward.

                Losing Sight of the Objective
            </div>
            <div class="infoCont">
                It’s easy to get tunnel vision during development. But losing track of the bigger picture, can be a detriment to your end product. Remember, the idea for your product or service came from a need to provide something new to a customer.
            </div>
            <div class="infoCont infoContBot">
                The customer, or end user, should always be kept top of mind, as they are the ones that will be purchasing and using your product. So take the time to test the market and gain & evaluate feedback so you can provide the best experience for your users.

                Follow these simple tips to make your meetings more productive and enjoyable:
            </div>
            <ul class="spis">
                <li>Create (and stick to!) an agenda</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="infoCont">

            </div>

            <ul class="spis">
                <li>Keep meetings to 30 mins and end early when possible</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="infoCont">
                Don’t fill the time just because you blocked off your calendar. Once you accomplish your agenda items, release everyone so they can get back to work or allow them the remaining time to take a break before returning to their desk.
            </div>
            <ul class="spis">
                <li>Invite only necessary employees</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="infoCont">
                f you are an executive or department head, consider having someone else lead the meeting instead. Training your employees to run meetings without you can be an empowering move for them and a time saver for you!
